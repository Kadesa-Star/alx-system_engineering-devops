Web Stack Debugging
Web stack debugging involves identifying and fixing issues in the software stack that supports web applications. This stack typically includes the following components:

Web Server:

Examples: Apache, Nginx.
Purpose: Serves web pages to clients and handles HTTP requests.
Application Server:

Examples: Gunicorn, uWSGI.
Purpose: Runs the application code and communicates with the web server.
Database Server:

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
Purpose: Stores and manages data used by the application.
Operating System:

Examples: Ubuntu, CentOS.
Purpose: Provides the underlying platform for all software components.
Debugging Goals
Identify Issues:

Symptoms: Errors in logs, slow performance, service outages.
Tools: Log files, monitoring tools, error messages.
Diagnose Problems:

Logs Analysis: Examine logs from web servers, application servers, and databases.
Configuration Review: Check configurations for correctness.
System Metrics: Monitor CPU, memory, disk usage, and network traffic.
Apply Fixes:

Configuration Changes: Update configurations to resolve issues.
Software Updates: Apply patches or updates to fix bugs.
Resource Allocation: Adjust resource limits or optimize performance.
Test and Verify:

Testing: Ensure that fixes address the problem without introducing new issues.
Verification: Confirm that the web stack is functioning correctly.
Common Debugging Tasks
Check Service Status:

Verify that all necessary services (web server, application server, database) are running.
Review Logs:

Examine logs for errors or warnings that indicate problems.
Verify Configuration:

Ensure that configuration files are set up correctly and adhere to best practices.
Monitor Performance:

Use monitoring tools to track performance metrics and identify bottlenecks.
Test Connectivity:

Confirm that all components can communicate with each other as expected.
Example Debugging Scenarios
Web Server Not Responding:

Check: Service status, error logs.
Fix: Restart the web server, resolve configuration errors.
Application Not Accessible:

Check: Application server status, web server logs.
Fix: Restart the application server, check network connectivity.
Database Connection Issues:

Check: Database server status, connection settings.
Fix: Restart the database server, update connection settings.
Project Example
For the "0x12. Web stack debugging #2" project:

Objective: Debug and fix issues related to running commands under different users in a web stack environment.
Script: Create a script to run whoami under a specified user to verify user permissions and configuration.
Conclusion
Web stack debugging is a crucial skill for maintaining reliable and performant web applications. It involves a systematic approach to identifying and resolving issues across multiple components of the web stack, ensuring that the entire system operates smoothly and efficiently.
