Steps to Accomplish the Task:
Understand the Problem:

The initial test with ApacheBench shows 943 failed requests out of 2000.
The main objective is to identify the cause of these failed requests and fix them using a Puppet manifest.
Use Logs to Identify the Issue:

Check the Nginx logs (/var/log/nginx/error.log and /var/log/nginx/access.log) to identify any errors or issues that may be causing the failed requests.
Look for clues like timeout errors, 500 status codes, or any other anomalies.
Common Causes of Failed Requests:

Insufficient worker processes: Nginx might not have enough worker processes to handle the load.
Connection limits: The server might be hitting connection limits or rate-limiting policies.
Resource limits: The server might be running out of memory or CPU resources, causing it to drop requests.
Timeout settings: Nginx might be timing out on requests if the timeout settings are too low.
Fix the Issue in the Puppet Manifest:

Create or modify the Puppet manifest file (0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp) to adjust Nginx's configuration to handle more concurrent request
