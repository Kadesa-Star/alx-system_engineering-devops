webstack debugging

Project Breakdown:
WordPress on LAMP Stack:

Linux: The operating system, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
Apache: The web server running WordPress.
MySQL: The database management system where WordPress stores its data.
PHP: The server-side scripting language used by WordPress.
Debugging:

Since logs might not provide enough information, you'll need to explore the full stack:
Apache Logs: Check /var/log/apache2/ for error logs.
PHP Logs: Check /var/log/php_errors.log or configured error log locations in php.ini.
MySQL Logs: Check /var/log/mysql/ for database-related issues.
WordPress Logs: Enable WP_DEBUG in wp-config.php to display or log errors.
Puppet Manifests:

Your task includes writing Puppet manifests, which are scripts that automate the configuration and management of the LAMP stack and WordPress.
Make sure your manifests:
Start with a comment explaining their purpose.
Pass puppet-lint checks for code quality.
Are compatible with Puppet v3.4.
Use the .pp file extension.
